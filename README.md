Docker file that extends very slightly on the [anaconda3](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/docker-images/tree/master/anaconda3) docker image.

In particular, it has some add-ons to make Jupyter notebooks a bit easier to work with. See the Dockerfile for more details.

Feel free to add additional packages that you find useful.
